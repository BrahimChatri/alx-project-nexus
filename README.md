# 📚 ALX Project Nexus – Job Board Platform Backend

Welcome to my `alx-project-nexus` repository! This project serves as a comprehensive documentation hub for my journey through the **ProDev Backend Engineering Program**. It reflects the knowledge, tools, challenges, and best practices I’ve acquired, and showcases my final capstone project: **Job Board Platform Backend**.

---

## 🚀 Capstone Project: Job Board Platform Backend

The goal of this backend project is to build a fully functional, scalable API that powers a job board platform. The system allows companies to post jobs and job seekers to apply — using Django and Django REST Framework.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Consolidate backend engineering concepts and skills learned throughout the program.
- Build a real-world backend application with RESTful API endpoints.
- Apply best practices in design, development, and documentation.
- Collaborate with frontend learners for API integration and testing.

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings & Technologies

### 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Django**
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Docker & Docker Compose**
- **Celery + RabbitMQ** (for background task processing)
- **Swagger / drf-yasg** (for API documentation)
- **Git & GitHub**
- **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**

---

## 🧩 Backend Concepts Covered

- RESTful API design and implementation
- Authentication and permission management
- Database modeling and relational design
- Filtering, searching, and pagination
- Asynchronous processing (email notifications, background tasks)
- API documentation and testing
- Secure coding practices (input validation, JWT)
- Version control and Git collaboration
- Containerization and deployment

---

## 📦 Core Features of the Job Board Platform

### 👤 User Authentication
- Register, Login, Logout
- Role-based users: `Job Seeker` and `Employer`
- JWT-based token authentication

### 📝 Job Management
- Employers can create, update, delete job postings
- Job fields: title, description, location, salary, deadline, etc.
- Jobs are publicly visible to all users

### 🔍 Job Listings & Filtering
- List all jobs
- Filter by title, company, location, or salary
- Search and pagination for large datasets

### 📥 Job Applications
- Job Seekers can apply to jobs
- Applications include job reference, user, and optional CV upload
- Employers can view applications for their job posts

### 📤 Email Notifications (Optional/Advanced)
- Confirmation email after successful application
- Managed asynchronously using Celery + RabbitMQ

### 📄 API Documentation
- Auto-generated docs using Swagger (`drf-yasg`)
- Includes all endpoints and schema definitions

---

## 🧪 Testing
- Unit and integration tests using Django's testing framework
- Tests for:
  - Authentication
  - Job operations
  - Application endpoints
  - Permissions and validations

---

## 🐳 Docker & CI/CD
- Dockerized backend and PostgreSQL services
- GitHub Actions to automate testing on push and pull requests

---

## ✅ Best Practices Followed

- Modular project structure (separate apps for clarity)
- Use of environment variables for secrets
- Input validation and permission checks
- DRY principles and reusable serializers/views
- Clean commit history and Git branching
