# 📚 ALX Project Nexus – Job Board Platform Backend

Welcome to my `alx-project-nexus` repository! This project serves as a comprehensive documentation hub for my journey through the **ProDev Backend Engineering Program**. It reflects the knowledge, tools, challenges, and best practices I’ve acquired, and showcases my final capstone project: **Job Board Platform Backend**.

---

## 🚀 Capstone Project: Job Board Platform Backend

The goal of this backend project is to build a fully functional, scalable API that powers a job board platform. The system allows companies to post jobs and job seekers to apply — using Django and Django REST Framework.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Consolidate backend engineering concepts and skills learned throughout the program.
- Build a real-world backend application with RESTful API endpoints.
- Apply best practices in design, development, and documentation.
- Collaborate with frontend learners for API integration and testing.

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings & Technologies

### 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Django**
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Docker & Docker Compose**
- **Celery + RabbitMQ** (for background task processing)
- **Swagger / drf-yasg** (for API documentation)
- **Git & GitHub**
- **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**

---

## 🧩 Backend Concepts Covered

- RESTful API design and implementation
- Authentication and permission management
- Database modeling and relational design
- Filtering, searching, and pagination
- Asynchronous processing (email notifications, background tasks)

- PostgreSQL (or use SQLite for development)
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BrahimChatri/alx-project-nexus.git
   cd alx-project-nexus
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment:**
   ```bash

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up database:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Create superuser (optional):**
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. **Populate sample data:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py populate_data
   ```

7. **Run the development server:**
